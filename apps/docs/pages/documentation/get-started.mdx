## Play Online

If you just want to play around with NEXT UI without setting up a project, you can use one of our online sandboxes:

## Automatic Installation
Using the [CLI]() is the easiest way to start a NEXT UI project. You can initialize your project directly via the CLI:

```bash [npx]
npx @next-design-labs/next-ui-cli@latest create
```

## Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use the CLI, follow these steps to manually set up NEXT UI in your project:

<Steps>

### Install packages

To use NEXT UI in your project, run the following command:
`react` and `react-dom` are peer dependencies and must be included in your project. 

```bash [npm]
npm install @next-design-labs/next-ui-core @mui/base
```

### Provider Setup

It is essential to add the NEXT UI Provider at the root of your application.

```javascript
import * as React from "react";

// 1. import `Provider` component
import { Provider } from "@next-design-labs/next-ui-core";

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap Provider at the root of your app
  return (
    <Provider>
      <YourApplication />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

### Use the components

After setting up the provider, you can start using the components provided.

```javascript
import { HvTypography } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <HvTypography>Hello from the NEXT UI team!</HvTypography>;
};
```

</Steps>
